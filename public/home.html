We understand that children heal and grow when they feel safe and understood.   Our approach goes beyond routines and expectations - it is guided by trusted relationships, predictable environments, and a deep, psychological understanding of each child’s unique needs and individual experiences.  At Acorn Wood, we provide specialist support for children age five to sixteen years. Our model of care is not only about meeting basic needs; it is about helping children to self-regulate, reflect and build resilience, whilst moving from surviving in the world to truly thriving.   Every child in our care is offered a safe place to belong and a carefully tended path to grow.</div>

                    At Acorn Wood, we know that children thrive in family-like,
                    nurturing environments. Our small, carefully designed homes
                    and our specialist day school provides the safety,
                    connection, and consistency that our children need to heal,
                    grow, and build confidence. By intentionally keeping our
                    service small, we are able to prioritise each child as a
                    unique individual, offering deeply personalised
                    opportunities that support recovery, growth, and lifelong
                    impact. Our approach is human-centred, not driven by
                    efficiency or scale - focused on building strong
                    relationships, supporting emotional wellbeing, fostering
                    curiosity, and nurturing a lifelong love of learning.   With
                    relationships, empathy, and connection as our central
                    priority, every child receives the care and guidance they
                    need to heal, grow, explore, and thrive.
